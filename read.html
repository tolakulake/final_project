              <h3> Stop Saying, 'You're So Smart!'' 3 Better Ways to Praise Kids <small>  posted on April 20, 2017</small></h3>
            </div>
            <img class = "featureImg" src = "img/praise.jpg" width = "100%">
            <p> Our child performs; we praise often without thought. What's the harm, right? After all, it's just a quick verbal pat on the back. But here's the harm: Praise often motivates children... to receive more praise. And when praise labels a child (e.g., 'I am smart'), it's easy to focus on looking good instead of learning. In fact, this focus on looking good can become so intense that it encumbers kids from taking simple chances such as raising their hands in class. In short, telling kids they are 'smart' can make them act the opposite. So how should we praise our kids to build an effective motivational framework? Check out three research-based strategies below.</p>
         </div>

            <h4> Praise the process, not the person </h4>
            <p> The research: In groundbreaking studies, researcher Carol Dweck found that the way we praise kids can affect their mindset and, in turn, their propensity to take on challenges, persevere and succeed academically. Dweck identified two particular mindsets: fixed versus growth.

Kids with fixed mindsets believe things such as intelligence, character and creative ability are innate and immutable. In other words, no matter how much they study or how much effort they exert, they're pretty much stuck with the cards they've been dealt. Because children with fixed mindsets believe their potential is capped, they avoid challenges that test their abilities.

On the other hand, kids with a growth mindset believe the brain is a muscle that can grow, and abilities are assets to be nurtured through hard work. Kids with growth mindsets believe that what they are born with are raw materials-a launching point. As a result, they thrive on challenges.
Dweck and colleagues demonstrated the difference in mindsets during one experiment in which 4-year-olds were asked to work on jigsaw puzzles. They were given a choice to either work on an easy puzzle they had already completed or try a more challenging one. Those with fixed mindsets chose to redo the easier puzzles, thus affirming their existing abilities. Those with growth mindsets thought the choice was odd to begin with: why would someone do the same puzzle again instead of learning something new? The growth-mindset children opted to stretch themselves by tackling the more challenging puzzles. In sum, growth mindset children relate success to the act of becoming smarter rather than demonstrating they are already smart..</p>

          <h4> Keep it real: Don't say, 'Good job!'' when it's not. </h4>
          <p>The research: Another pioneer in the field, psychologist Wulf-Uwe Meyer, found in a series of experiments that only kids under the age of seven accept praise at face value; older children are just as suspicious of praise as adults. In fact, by the age of 12, children scrutinize words of praise for truth and hidden agendas. After all, they usually know whether they actually did a good job.

Meyer's studies found children believed that receiving praise from a teacher was not a sign of doing well; rather, it was a sign the teacher thought they lacked ability and needed extra encouragement. These kids had detected a pattern: Kids who are falling behind are drowned in praise. Even more interesting, Meyer shows that teens discounted praise to such extent that they felt a teacher's criticism was a better indicator of doing well. </p>
